It's nice to reflect back from when I first started this course, which was about a month ago, and to see how much I've learned in just that short amount of time. I've definitely already had some ups and downs. It's satisfying when your code is correct and you run  'learn' and see all green, however on flip-side it's frustrating when you can't figure out how to pass that one last test - ie. me currently on the OO My Pets lab. 

With that being said, overall I've noticed a big difference in my undestanding of the lingo when simply reading the requirements of a lab. This may seem small, but it just reminds me that I am learning - especially since before I started this course, I didn't even know what a terminal was. It will be exciting to look back at this blog and hopefully I have figured out how to pass the OO My Pets Lab by then!
