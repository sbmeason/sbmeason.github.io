My curiosity for software engineering peaked about 3 years ago. I had no previous experience, but would hear chatter about the requirements, the responsbilities and the various programming languages that engineers were using. I was exposed to this because of my previous job as a Technical Recruiter. All of this knowledge that I was beginning to gain about software engineering was very surface level,  but caused me to dive deeper and do my own research. I love to learn and problem solve and I've realized that the field is incredibly broad and can open different doors that I wouldn't have even thought about before. 

Fast forward a couple of years later, I finally gained the courage to take my curiousty and new found passion and take a chance and step outside of my comfort zone. This led me to apply to Flatiron School and study software engineering. While I've never coded before and don't have a background in it, I'm excited to really dive deep and learn a new skill.
